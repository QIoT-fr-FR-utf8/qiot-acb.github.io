## Axians Cloud Builder

![axians](img/axians.png)

Axians is the VINCI Energies brand dedicated to ICT.

Axians Cloud Builder, part of Axians, delivers turnkey IT solutions in the areas of storage, servers, networks and virtualisation.

## Roles

As mentionned on the index page (go NOW if you hadn't read it!!), we are a 5 people team.

We are mostly ops, sysadmins, system architects, or whatever you want to call us (except DevOps Engineer which is NOT a role !), so developping Cloud Native Apps on an Edge/IoT device is a big challenge for us!

Knowing this, we split the team in 3 subteams:
* IoT Sensors guys
* Edge Service guys
* T-shirt guys

### IoT Sensors team

* Who:
  * David Auffray
  * Rémi Verchère
* What:
  * To make RPI works ASAP
  * To provide sensors metrics using python flask application
  * To build images and push to [quay.io](https://www.quay.io)
* Particularities:
  * Old
  * Bearded
  * Work at night

### Edge Service team

* Who: 
  * Sébastien Davoult
  * Jérémy Hoarau
  * Chamseddine Saadoune
* What:
  * To develop Edge Service using Quarkus
  * I know, it's just one thing, but a **big** one!
* Particularities:
  * Young
  * Try to be bearded
  * Do not work at night, and maybe not during the day either

### T-shirt team

Yes, we have a dedicated t-shirt for this event! See:
