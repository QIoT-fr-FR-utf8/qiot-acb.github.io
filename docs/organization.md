## Axians Cloud Builder

## Roles

As mentionned on the index page (go NOW if you hadn't read it!!), we are a 5 people team.

We are mostly ops, sysadmins, system architects, or whatever you want to call us (except DevOps Engineer which is NOT a role !), so developping Cloud Native Apps on an Edge/IoT device is a big challenge for us!

Knowing this, we split the team in 3 subteams:
* IoT Sensors guys, who focus on RPi bootstrapping, Python application and Container images build
* Edge Service guys, who focus on Quarkus application
* T-shirt guys

### IoT Sensors team

* Who: David Auffray and Rémi Verchère
* What:
  * To make RPI works ASAP
  * To provide sensors metrics using python flask application
  * To build images and push to [quay.io](https://www.quay.io)
* Particularities:
  * Old
  * Bearded
  * Work during the night
