Here some feedback to Red Hat team, after spending some (fun) time on this project!

All the remarks are not in a specific order.

## Pros

### Technical

1. Challenge to use a full Red Hat solution

1. Challenge to work with arm64/aarch64 architecture, playing with cross-compilation

1. Pratice with containers, especially with podman + quay

    * Build images
    * Push / Pull to registries
    * Use CI/CD to automate the process

1. Play with Python and Flask, even if it was not the primary goal of that project

1. Discover Quarkus, and all its potential on edge side!

1. Finally find a real use case for our RPis @ home :)

### Non technical

1. Our team is distributed, and we never have time to work on a same project. This was an opportunity for us to take some time together

1. Opportunity to enforce our Red Hat partnership

1. Find some time on innovative projects

## Cons

### Technical

1. Guidelines maybe too restrictive (compared to the previous public hackfest)

1. Frustrated to not work on OpenShift platform

1. No way to have debug / logs information on the DataHub platform

### Non technical

1. The project was done during our free time, mostly (business first!). Then it was difficult work asynchronisly, by night, with all the team

1. We would like to have more collaboration between teams. We are 12 teams, but only few were tchating / help on the dedicated slack channel
